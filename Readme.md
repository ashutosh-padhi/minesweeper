# minesweeper

An implementation of minesweeper for web. It is my second implementation of MVC architecture after tic tac toe. During my initial days of career I have created this game to understand web technologies and mvc architecture.

Just open the `index.html` in browser.

If I will get time in future. I will make this classic game more creative and fun to play.
